# Review Cycle Checklist

Use this checklist every time a Codex review completes.

## Triage suggestions
- Tag each suggestion as: apply / ignore / clarify.
- Apply only suggestions that are logically valid and improve the implementation.
- If ignoring, note a brief justification in the PR discussion.

## Apply valid suggestions
- Implement the change in the same branch and PR.
- Keep commits small and scoped to the suggestion.
- Re-run impacted tests when appropriate.

## Repeat
- Request another Codex review.
- Repeat until there are no further suggestions.
